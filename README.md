# VPJD2024

Feel free to contact me at jeroen.janssen@gmail.com if you have any questions or additions.

These are my notes from the Vocal Pop &amp; Jazz Days 2024.
Collected from discussions with several people on the topics of:

- (AI) Rehearsal Tracks
- The practice of learning new songs (and how to help the brain)

My intention for this is it be a shared resource for everyone that is interested in these topics. There are a lot different approaches to things.

Be open to the the knowledge and experience from others and use whatever fits your needs or situation the best. 

There is no one way.

## Rehearsal Track Notes

- Piano sounds are typically to short (e.g. when playing long notes)
- Vibraphone/Saxophone/Clarinet are perceived to be not useable by (some?) people
  - pitch needs to be clear/consistent and not drift/no vibrato
- Different styles/versions
  - conductor plays piano and records it as a rehearsal track
  - conductor sings part and records it as a rehearsal track
  - without/with other voice parts
    - note: it is important to hear your voice in connection to the other voice parts
- not everyone can sing and record the soprano/bass parts
- also very useful for new singers in the choir
- breathing sounds are also very important!
- different mixes
  - part only (with/without others softly)
  - stereo mix (part on left, rest on the right)
  - click track\
  - no part (everything except a specific part)
- Can also use a loopstation to record rehearsal tracks
- Choir members could also use MuseScore and "choose their own mix" (but this requires sharing the score file)


## Rehearsing Notes

- rehearse behind piano (and play notes of sections repeatedly)
- writing down lyrics by hand (to better remember)
- Using choregraphy with the song (to better remember)
- Rehearse with metronome on 2 and 4 to get timing better
- [Count Singing](https://acda-publications.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ChorTeach_vol.3_Wine,T.pdf) is the practice of rehearsing a choral work on counts rather than singing the text.
- Use [Basic Steps (VoPa, Intelligent Choir)](https://youtu.be/f1Wy0FFQlYA?si=gGDjbGtt76gVl5p3&t=992) for choir to learn internalize groove/timing.
- analyze score before rehearsing
  - find out which interval you are singing within the chord (1-3-5-7-9, etc) to understand your sound within the whole
  - figure out structure of the song (from AABA form and lyrics perspective),

## Brain Notes

- [Brain Gym](https://www.leneurogroupe.org/brain-gym?lang=en#:~:text=The%20Brain%20Gym%20program%20consists,%2C%20centering%2C%20comprehension%20and%20concentration) is a method using movement and artistic activities to improve learning abilities.
- To sing from memory, you need to actively "put the paper down" early in rehearsals (not "at the end")
- [Audiation](https://kb.gcsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=grposters#:~:text=Audiation%20is%20the%20cognitive%20ability,is%20a%20manifestation%20of%20audiation) is the cognitive ability to internally hear and understand music.

## Software Notes

- Musescore scanning sheet music does not give satisfying results at the moment
  - typing in by hand instead
  - or correcting scanned parts
- Mix different part tracks by hand (changing volume, export, multiple times)
- What is possible? How to start? Introduction/Workshop?
- AI Voice Programs
  - [Vocaloid](https://www.vocaloid.com/en/vocaloid6/)
    - Trial version 31 days
    - $225, includes 14 voices
  - [Synthesizer V Studio](https://dreamtonics.com/synthesizerv/)
    - Basic (free, no advanced features)
    - Pro (paid) $89 without voices, voice packs typically $90
  - [Ace Studio](https://www.acestudio.ai)
    - 14 day trial
    - Subscription monthly($22/m)/yearly($13/m), includes voices
- Choir Rehearse App
  - [Rehearse App](http://www.rehearse.nl/welcome-to-the-rehearse-app/) for anyone who wants to practice anywhere alone, to be well prepared to rehearse or perform together later on. Rehearse was first designed to be used in the Netherlands, but also supports other languages.
- correcting a scan
  - listen to a part while looking at the sheetmusic and check for incorrect things
  - or use entering lyrics as a way to check if all the rhythm of the notes are correct (if not then the syllables will not match up) 
- PlayScore2 scanning sheetmusic
- capella-scan
- converted midi files (from scanning) sometimes have issues with time signature changes

## Thanks

Thank you to all the participants at the Vocal Pop & Jazz Days that I got to talk about these topics during our week. I was not expecting such positive feedback and different perspectives on this. We have a great singing communitity and it is amazing to learn from others and also be able to share my experiences and knowledge to people.

## TODO

- process my latest notes
- add links to example ai choir videos (vocaloid, ace studio, synthesizer v)
- add links to existing choir instruction/demo videos of applications
  - including vocoflex
- make overview picture of different ways to approach creating rehearsal tracks

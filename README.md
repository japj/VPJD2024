# VPJD2024
Notes from Vocal Pop &amp; Jazz Days 2024
Collected from discussions with several people on the topics of:

- (AI) Rehearsal Tracks
- The practice of learning new songs (and how to help the brain)

## Rehearsal Track Notes

- Piano sounds are typically to short (e.g. when playing long notes)
- Vibraphone/Saxophone/Clarinet are perceived to be not useable by (some?) people
  - pitch needs to be clear/consistent and not drift/no vibrato
- Different styles/versions
  - conductor plays piano and records it as a rehearsal track
  - conductor sings part and records it as a rehearsal track
  - without/with other voice parts
    - note: it is important to hear your voice in connection to the other voice parts
- not everyone can sing and record the soprano/bass parts
- also very useful for new singers in the choir
- breathing sounds are also very important!

## Rehearsing Notes

- rehearse behind piano (and play notes of sections repeatedly)
- writing down lyrics by hand (to better remember)
- Using choregraphy with the song (to better remember)


## Brain Notes

- [Brain Gym](https://www.leneurogroupe.org/brain-gym?lang=en#:~:text=The%20Brain%20Gym%20program%20consists,%2C%20centering%2C%20comprehension%20and%20concentration) is a method using movement and artistic activities to improve learning abilities.
- To sing from memory, you need to actively "put the paper down" early in rehearsals (not "at the end")
- [Audtiation](https://kb.gcsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=grposters#:~:text=Audiation%20is%20the%20cognitive%20ability,is%20a%20manifestation%20of%20audiation) is the cognitive ability to internally hear and understand music.

## Software Notes

- Musescore scanning sheet music does not give satisfying results at the moment
  - typing in by hand instead
- Mix different part tracks by hand (changing volume, export, multiple times)
- What is possible? How to start? Introduction/Workshop?
